# Project Principles

1. Strict adherence to appropriate specifications, leveraging formal specs like W3C and implementing extensibility features fully.

2. Conservative message production matching specs exactly; liberal acceptance, filling in missing information where reasonable.

3. Fully embrace eventual consistency, using HTTP 202 responses, and not expecting immediate updates from API calls.
