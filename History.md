# Bien Oblige - Project History

## Exploratory Phase

The exploratory phase of this project took place in October and November of 2024. In this stage, we considered various possibilities for both requirements and implementation methods. Our goal was to thoroughly investigate potential approaches and gather insights that will inform future development decisions.

### Phase Objectives

* Requirement Analysis: We identified and evaluating different requirements that align with the project goals.
* Implementation Exploration: Various implementation methods were considered and assessed for feasibility and effectiveness.

We created our [Internal Press Release](docs/press/Internal%20Press%20Release.md), which provides a high-level overview of the project's vision and objectives.
