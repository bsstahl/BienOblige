## Detailed Features

* Tasks can be assigned to individuals or groups

* Tasks can be specified to be performed at a location.

* Projects or other high-level activities can be broken down into smaller tasks that can be assigned to individuals. These tasks roll-up to the main activity and can be used to track progress over a broader scope. There is no limit to the depth of this hierarch.

* Parent tasks can be closed automatically when all child tasks are closed, or they can be left open until manually closed.

* An *endTime* can be assigned to a task to indicate when it is due. The task can be set to expire at this time, or it can be set to remain open until it is manually closed.

* Tags of any object type can be added to a task to allow for customizable searching and filtering.

* A collection of *executorRequirement* objects can be specified to indicate the skills or other necessary qualifications required by the **executor** to perform a task.

* A collection of *prerequisite* **ActionItems** can be specified to indicate that a task cannot be started until one or more other tasks have been completed.
