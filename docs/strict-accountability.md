# Strict Accountability Policy

## Purpose

The shepherds of this project are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful community. This policy outlines our expectations regarding intolerance and discrimination, ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for all contributors and users.

## Scope

This policy applies to all members of our community, including contributors, maintainers, and users, across all platforms where our project is discussed or developed.

## Policy Statement

We hold a stance of strict accountability for any form of discrimination or harassment based on race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any other protected status. Our commitment is to uphold a community free from intolerance and prejudice.

## Expectations

* All interactions should be respectful and considerate of others' backgrounds and perspectives.
* Constructive feedback should be provided thoughtfully and respectfully.
* Offensive comments directed at any person are strictly prohibited, either expressly or through implication.
* Attempts to hide behind humor, sarcasm or other forms of plausible deniability to mask offensive behavior are not tolerated.

## Context Consideration

While our stance against intolerance is firm, we acknowledge that misunderstandings can occur. Each reported incident will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to understand the context and intent. However, exceptions will only be made in cases with compelling justifications.

## Consequences

Violations of this policy will result in actions proportionate to the severity of the behavior, which may include:

* Warning and education
* Temporary suspension from the project
* Permanent removal from the community

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this policy, please report it using the medium of the violation. All reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly.

## Commitment to Improvement

We are dedicated to continuous improvement and welcome feedback on how we can better uphold these values. Please feel free to reach out with suggestions or concerns.
