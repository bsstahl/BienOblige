# Revolutionizing Task Management Across Applications

Phoenix, November 2, 2024 â€” We are thrilled to announce **Bien Oblige**, a groundbreaking solution designed to transform task management across multiple applications, making it more efficient and centralized.

In today's digital landscape, organizations often face challenges in managing tasks across various platforms. This fragmentation can lead to inefficiencies and difficulty in tracking progress across the value-stream.

## Limitations of Current Solutions

Many existing applications maintain their own tasks in isolation, and utilize different structures for the data. This lack of integration makes it difficult to see the big picture of everything that needs to be done to deliver value, and to identify bottlenecks and other pain-points in the value-stream.
