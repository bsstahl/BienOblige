# Introducing Assignment with Future Accept/Reject Capabilities

## Decision Group

* Proposed | 2024-11-27

## Problem/Issue

Our task management system needs a formalized process for task assignments and the potential for users to accept or reject tasks. To ensure the system's effectiveness, we need a flexible approach that supports simple task assignments now and can seamlessly evolve to optionally include accept/reject functionalities in the future.

## Decision

We will implement a task assignment system that initially assumes tasks are automatically accepted upon assignment, though they will not be marked as such. This system will be designed with the future capability to introduce an accept/reject mechanism, allowing users to explicitly manage their task assignments. This approach ensures we meet current operational needs while strategically preparing for enhanced user interaction and workflow management.

## Considered Alternatives

* **Immediate Introduction of Accept/Reject Mechanism**: Launching with a full accept/reject functionality, potentially complicating the initial adoption and increasing initial development complexity.

* **No Planned Enhancements**: Keeping the task assignment system static, without the capability to introduce accept/reject functionalities in the future, potentially limiting the system's flexibility and scalability.

## Arguments

### Pro

* **Immediate Solution with Future Growth**: Meets the immediate need for a task assignment system while laying the groundwork for enhanced functionalities, ensuring long-term scalability.

* **User Familiarity and Adoption**: Introduces users to the system in its simplest form, promoting adoption and reducing initial resistance, while preparing them for future functionalities.

* **Resource Efficiency**: Allows for a phased development approach, optimizing resource allocation and focusing on immediate needs before adding complexity.

* **Risk Mitigation**: By initially implementing a simpler version, we minimize potential disruptions and ensure stability as we test and refine the future accept/reject mechanism.

### Con

* **Delayed Full Functionality**: Users will not have accept/reject capabilities immediately, which could limit early feedback on this feature and delay its optimization.

* **Unclosed Loop**: By assuming acceptance, we are making it possible for a user to "miss" the assignment silently, since there is no explicit acceptance or rejection. This could lead to confusion or missed tasks.

* **Future Transition Required**: Introducing a significant change to the workflow could require additional training and adjustment for users, impacting the smoothness of the transition.
